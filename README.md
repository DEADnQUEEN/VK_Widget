# VK_Widget
Widget, which authorize you by QR code and showing to you dialogs with count of unread messages

To download and setup application use this link: https://disk.yandex.ru/d/v0uUEvPLHGHPSw

After setup you will see some bottons:

- Close - close app

- Minimize - minimaze app

- Pin - pin app over other windows

- Home - return you to main window

- VK logo button - after click image will set to QR code, which authorize you in your account and parse your dialog data


All the logic and calculations of the program are carried out on your computer, and an Internet connection is required only to update the dialogs and the number of messages. 
All your data is confidential and is not sent/collected by me, since I do not have a storage for a possible huge amount of data

I'm really think that i can add integration with telegramm in thiss application, but my logic, based on selenium webbrowser isn't wanna perse this site. Maybe later, when i lern some new skills/framework and will have a work experience bigger then right now (currently this one is equals to 0 :( ), than i will end this idea. application frame and all code fragments are prepared to some addictions, so if you have any ideas/realisations/tech sollutins, than sad about them and i will add this into my code.
